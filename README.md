# Grice-LLM-Cooperation

**Applying Griceâ€™s Cooperative Principle to LLM Design & Evaluation**

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository explores how Paul Griceâ€™s Cooperative Principleâ€”comprising the four conversational maxims (Quantity, Quality, Relevance, Manner)â€”can guide both the **design** and **evaluation** of Large Language Models (LLMs). We survey theoretical frameworks, present empirical evaluations of model behavior against Gricean norms, and demonstrate prompting and interface techniques for fostering truly cooperative AI dialogue.

##Project Goals

1. **Theoretical Foundations**  
   â€“ Map Griceâ€™s maxims to computational dialogue systems.  
   â€“ Review extensions (e.g. Benevolence, Transparency) tailored for AI.

2. **Empirical Evaluation**  
   â€“ Analyze LLM performance (GPTâ€‘3 through GPTâ€‘4) on tasks like implicature resolution, informativeness, truthfulness, and clarity.

3. **Tools & Notebooks**  
   â€“ Readyâ€‘toâ€‘run Python notebooks with examples of normâ€‘based prompting, evaluation scripts, and visualizations.
