# Grice-LLM-Cooperation

**Applying Grice’s Cooperative Principle to LLM Design & Evaluation**

---

## Overview

This repository explores how Paul Grice’s Cooperative Principle—comprising the four conversational maxims (Quantity, Quality, Relevance, Manner)—can guide both the **design** and **evaluation** of Large Language Models (LLMs). We survey theoretical frameworks, present empirical evaluations of model behavior against Gricean norms, and demonstrate prompting and interface techniques for fostering truly cooperative AI dialogue.

## Project Goals

1. **Theoretical Foundations**  
   – Map Grice’s maxims to computational dialogue systems.  
   – Review extensions (e.g. Benevolence, Transparency) tailored for AI.

2. **Empirical Evaluation**  
   – Analyze LLM performance (GPT‑3 through GPT‑4) on tasks like implicature resolution, informativeness, truthfulness, and clarity.

3. **Tools & Notebooks**  
   – Ready‑to‑run Python notebooks with examples of norm‑based prompting, evaluation scripts, and visualizations.
